Mission
-------
Miami College of Design was created to support the future leaders in design and innovation. Our students interact with design principles in concert with the natural sciences, material sciences, computing, communications, and structural engineering.

Our mission is to create a globally recognized undergraduate program in industrial design.

Our objective is to create a learning environment in which students work side-by-side with leading-edge designers, immersed in professional practice, to create disruptions and, consequently, opportunities for innovation.

Our vision is that our students will be instrumental in the creation of the next generation of strategic, innovative and entrepreneurial businesses.

We seek to advance the integration of design, science, and engineering, exploring new approaches and solutions through experience design. We value active learning, exploration, creativity, breakthrough innovation, and the use of technology and applied design, all of which serve to advance the quality of the human experience.

Vision and Purpose
------------------
In today's competitive landscape, where high-technology businesses are becoming the common
paradigm, innovation is crucial. To nurture talent, we must create learning environments in
which there is creative tension between a shared vision (stability) and open-ended risk taking
(instability). From these environments, top students will emerge who can innovate from chaos.

These students will generate long-term value through the development of distinctive products;
they will be instrumental in the creation of the next generation of strategic businesses as they
contribute with disruptive, breakthrough innovation leadership.
