	  <p>Courses are taken sequentially by level. Each semester credit hour is a unit consisting of a minimum of fifteen hours of instruction appropriate to the level of credential sought, during a semester, plus a reasonable period of time outside of instruction which is required for preparation for learning experiences, such as preparation for instruction, study of course material, or completion of educational projects.</p>

	  <p>The course numbers are based on course codes established by the school and do not relate to state common-course numbering systems. The course numbers were created by using the first few letters of the name of the program and then three numbers to indicate level or sequence. Courses numbered in the 100s and 200s are designed for students enrolled in both the associates and bachelors programs. Course numbers in the 300s and 400s are designed for students enrolled in the bachelors program. For example, ID-101 is an introductory level Industrial Design class intended for Year-1 students. ID-204 is a more advanced course in Industrial Design intended for Year-2 students. Similarly, MATH indicates courses in mathematics; COMP indicates courses in computer science; SOCSCI indicates courses in the social sciences; NATSCI indicates courses in the natural sciences; HUM indicates courses in the humanities; EPS indicates courses in business and entrepreneurship; and SM indicates academic seminars.</p>

	  <p>Students are provided with a course syllabus at the start of each course. It contains the following:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Method of evaluation</li>
	      <li>Course requirements</li>
	      <li>Value towards final grade</li>
