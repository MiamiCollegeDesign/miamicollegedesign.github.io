	  <h2 class="uppercase">TUITION FEES AND OTHER COSTS</h2>
	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Tuition</em></h3>
	  <p>Tuition is due at the time of registration for each semester. The fee is US $1020 per semester credit-hour unit. The total cost of tuition for the bachelor’s degree is US $147,900 (145 credit hours). The total cost of tuition for the associate’s degree is US $66,300 (65 credit hours). Tuition includes the cost of instructors and administration, as well as internships, mentoring, and student services. Qualified students will receive a scholarship for up to 90% of tuition only (Please refer to the Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program Section below).</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Application Fee</em></h3>
	  <p>There is a one-time US $25 nonrefundable application fee due at the time of application. The application fee must be paid either by credit card or in the form of a personal check, cash, or money order made payable to Miami College of Design. This is the responsibility of the applicant.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Cost of Books, Equipment, and Supplies</em></h3>
	  <p>The price of learning materials, equipment, and supplies varies, with an average cost of US $75 per course. These costs are the responsibility of the student.</p>

	  <h2 class="uppercase">Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program</h2>
	  <p>Miami College of Design seeks to attract the most talented students both in and out of the State of Florida. The goal is to train talented individuals who will become innovators in their communities. Our focus is to deeply involve the local and greater industrial design communities to gain their support in the education of students who can one day make a difference to these organizations.</p>

	  <p>Our approach to student tuition assistance is to involve industry partners by establishing the Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program. The program details include:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Applicants must go through a rigorous admissions process showing that they have creativity, an innovative spirit, design talent and initiative, a teamwork mindset, and the goal to complete their studies within the time allotted;</li>
	      <li>Accepted applicants will be named Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars. Scholars will, wherever possible, be paired with an industry donor who has agreed to sponsor the Scholars Program;</li>
	      <li>Scholars will, wherever possible, be assigned to a Sponsor work site for project and classroom work and internships;</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>To the extent that funds are available, tuition awards will be granted to each qualified student who is accepted into the Scholars Program. These are students who meet both the admission and the Scholars requirements. The awards program, known as Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program, is an example of the innovative approach to post-secondary education tuition assistance developed by Miami College of Design. Up to 90% of tuition for qualified students will be paid through the scholars program. Students must qualify annually for scholarships while enrolled in either the Associate's or Bachelor’s degree programs.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	  <p>There are Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholarships available for 2017, which will be awarded based on both merit and means. Students who are awarded scholarships will be responsible for at least 10% of tuition. For example: If a student enrolls in 18 credit hours in a semester, the total tuition for that semester is US $18,360. A 90% scholarship recipient will be responsible for US $1,836 of that total. A 50% scholarship recipient will be responsible for US $9,180 of that total. Students who are not awarded scholarships will be responsible for 100% of tuition as described in the Tuition Section above.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	  <p>All students are responsible for their portion of tuition as decribed above, the one-time application fee of US $25, and learning materials, equipment, and supplies, which have an average cost of US $75 per course.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>The Scholars Program Application Process</em></h3>
	  <p>All applicants to the College and currently enrolled students in good standing are eligible to apply for the Scholars Program on an annual basis. New students will be considered for the program based upon their application for admission to the College as described in the Admissions Procedures and Requirements section of the Catalog. Currently enrolled students applying to the Scholars program must include examples of work from previous semesters. Continuing students may invite people to write letters of recommendation from College faculty and their mentors from industry.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Interview and Performance Assessment</em></h3>
	  <p>All Scholar applicants will have a face-to-face, in person or electronic interview. During the interview, applicants will be asked to discuss their experience working as part of a design team.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Acceptance into the Scholars Program</em></h3>
	  <p>Decisions regarding acceptance into the Scholars Program, as well as the percentage of tuition to be covered by the Scholars Program will be made within one month of the review by the Scholars Program Committee. This will be at least one month prior to the due date for submission of the enrollment agreement by new students for the semester in which they intend to enroll. Continuing students will be informed of their scholarship status three months prior to the Fall Semester.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>How are students selected?</em></h3>
	  <p>In addition to the standard admission process, students must prove to the Admissions Committee that they are highly qualified, goal-oriented, and committed to completion of their assigned work.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>What are the requirements to maintain good standing in the scholar program?</em></h3>
	  <p>A minimum cumulative grade average of 3.0 and enrollment of at least 9 credits per semester.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>How many scholarships are awarded?</em></h3>
	  <p>Scholarships are awarded to as many qualified students as possible based on available scholarship funding.</p>
