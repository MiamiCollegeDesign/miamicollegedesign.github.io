          <h2 class="uppercase">History</h2>
	  <p>The Miami College of Design is the culmination of the dreams of two leaders in industrial design and design education, Franco Lodato and Walter Bender.</p>

	  <p>Franco Lodato is a renowned industrial designer for Motorola, Herman Miller, Ferrari-Maserati, Pininfarina and other global enterprises. He is also the founder and principal of iBionics and chief product Innovation of Skylabs.</p>

	  <p>Walter Bender is a founding member and former Executive Director of the MIT Media Lab, co-founder of One Laptop per Child, and founder of Sugar Labs, an organization that provides educational software to children around the world.</p>

	  <p>Lodato and Bender as collaborators at MIT in the 1990s observed that design and technology were closely integrated in the development of new products. Consequently, the ability to deliver interdisciplinary education has become more essential than ever before.</p>

	  <p>Lodato and Bender realized they could create an innovative college where students could interact with design principles and also with the natural sciences, material sciences, computing, communications, and structural engineering.</p>

	  <p>This innovative education concept got the attention of Antonio Malavé. Mr. Malavé is a serial entrepreneur in the Miami area where he focuses on real estate project development. He is an expert in organizational and operational management and therefore assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer and part owner. He is responsible for daily operations, resource management, and strategic planning.</p>

	  <p><img src="images/deadlines.png"/></p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><a name="ADMISSIONS"><em>Acceptance by the College</em></a></h3>

	  <p>The criteria for acceptance into the program are based on a multi-dimensional metric. This includes:
<ul>
	    <li>academic achievement;</li>
	    <li>quality of the applicant's portfolio and writing samples;</li>
	    <li>the interview;</li>
	    <li>the results of the performance assessment;</li>
	    <li>letters of recommendation;</li>
	    <li>Admissions Committee assessment of character, talent, and ambition.</li>
</ul></p>
	  <p>Admissions decisions will be made on a rolling basis, generally within one month following the completion of all items on the Application Checklist and review by the Admissions Committee.</p>
	  <p>Upon acceptance, there are two documents which constitute a binding contract between the student and Miami College of Design: (1) the College Catalog, which students receive one week prior to enrollment; and (2) the Enrollment Agreement, containing your obligations with the College. Please read both documents carefully prior to signing the Enrollment Agreement.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Transfer of Credit Hours</em></h3>
	
	  <p>Some credit hours may be evaluated and considered towards program completion. The applicant must present a transcript and catalog from the institution where the courses were completed. The institution must be accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency and the grade must be a “B” or higher. Students must complete at least 50% of their course work at Miami College of Design in order to receive a degree. Tuition will be prorated.</p>
	
	  <p>Students may wish to continue their training after graduation. While Miami College of Design is licensed by the Florida Commission for Independent Education, it is not accredited. Some or none of the course work completed at Miami College of Design may be transferable to other institutions. Therefore, the student must contact the institution s/he is transferring to as each institution has its own requirements regarding acceptance of transfer of credit hours. There is no guarantee of transfer of credit hours from one institution to another and specifically from Miami College of Design to any other post-secondary school or college.</p>
	
	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Life Experience Credit</em></h3>
	
	  <p>Miami College of Design accepts up to 15 credit hours of life experience. Applicants must select courses for which they seek life experience credit. For each course, applicants must show how their specific experience meets the objectives of that course. This is done by completing forms, provided by the school, and including examples of work, job descriptions, and/or testimonials from employers. The Life Experience Application Package is reviewed by the Admissions Officer. When complete, then the Application package is submitted to a Life Experience Review Committee. Tuition for courses accepted for Life Experience credit will be prorated.</p>

	  <h2 class="uppercase">TUITION FEES AND OTHER COSTS</h2>
	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Tuition</em></h3>
	  <p>Tuition is due at the time of registration for each semester. The fee is US $1020 per semester credit-hour unit. The total cost of tuition for the bachelor’s degree is US $147,900 (145 credit hours). The total cost of tuition for the associate’s degree is US $66,300 (65 credit hours). Tuition includes the cost of instructors and administration, as well as internships, mentoring, and student services. Qualified students will receive a scholarship for up to 90% of tuition only (Please refer to the Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program Section below).</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Application Fee</em></h3>
	  <p>There is a one-time US $25 nonrefundable application fee due at the time of application. The application fee must be paid either by credit card or in the form of a personal check, cash, or money order made payable to Miami College of Design. This is the responsibility of the applicant.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Cost of Books, Equipment, and Supplies</em></h3>
	  <p>The price of learning materials, equipment, and supplies varies, with an average cost of US $75 per course. These costs are the responsibility of the student.</p>

	  <h2 class="uppercase">Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program</h2>
	  <p>Miami College of Design seeks to attract the most talented students both in and out of the State of Florida. The goal is to train talented individuals who will become innovators in their communities. Our focus is to deeply involve the local and greater industrial design communities to gain their support in the education of students who can one day make a difference to these organizations.</p>

	  <p>Our approach to student tuition assistance is to involve industry partners by establishing the Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program. The program details include:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Applicants must go through a rigorous admissions process showing that they have creativity, an innovative spirit, design talent and initiative, a teamwork mindset, and the goal to complete their studies within the time allotted;</li>
	      <li>Accepted applicants will be named Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars. Scholars will, wherever possible, be paired with an industry donor who has agreed to sponsor the Scholars Program;</li>
	      <li>Scholars will, wherever possible, be assigned to a Sponsor work site for project and classroom work and internships;</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>To the extent that funds are available, tuition awards will be granted to each qualified student who is accepted into the Scholars Program. These are students who meet both the admission and the Scholars requirements. The awards program, known as Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholars Program, is an example of the innovative approach to post-secondary education tuition assistance developed by Miami College of Design. Up to 90% of tuition for qualified students will be paid through the scholars program. Students must qualify annually for scholarships while enrolled in either the Associate's or Bachelor’s degree programs.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	  <p>There are Industrial Arts &amp; Method Scholarships available for 2017, which will be awarded based on both merit and means. Students who are awarded scholarships will be responsible for at least 10% of tuition. For example: If a student enrolls in 18 credit hours in a semester, the total tuition for that semester is US $18,360. A 90% scholarship recipient will be responsible for US $1,836 of that total. A 50% scholarship recipient will be responsible for US $9,180 of that total. Students who are not awarded scholarships will be responsible for 100% of tuition as described in the Tuition Section above.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	  <p>All students are responsible for their portion of tuition as decribed above, the one-time application fee of US $25, and learning materials, equipment, and supplies, which have an average cost of US $75 per course.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>The Scholars Program Application Process</em></h3>
	  <p>All applicants to the College and currently enrolled students in good standing are eligible to apply for the Scholars Program on an annual basis. New students will be considered for the program based upon their application for admission to the College as described in the Admissions Procedures and Requirements section of the Catalog. Currently enrolled students applying to the Scholars program must include examples of work from previous semesters. Continuing students may invite people to write letters of recommendation from College faculty and their mentors from industry.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Interview and Performance Assessment</em></h3>
	  <p>All Scholar applicants will have a face-to-face, in person or electronic interview. During the interview, applicants will be asked to discuss their experience working as part of a design team.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Acceptance into the Scholars Program</em></h3>
	  <p>Decisions regarding acceptance into the Scholars Program, as well as the percentage of tuition to be covered by the Scholars Program will be made within one month of the review by the Scholars Program Committee. This will be at least one month prior to the due date for submission of the enrollment agreement by new students for the semester in which they intend to enroll. Continuing students will be informed of their scholarship status three months prior to the Fall Semester.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>How are students selected?</em></h3>
	  <p>In addition to the standard admission process, students must prove to the Admissions Committee that they are highly qualified, goal-oriented, and committed to completion of their assigned work.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>What are the requirements to maintain good standing in the scholar program?</em></h3>
	  <p>A minimum cumulative grade average of 3.0 and enrollment of at least 9 credits per semester.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>How many scholarships are awarded?</em></h3>
	  <p>Scholarships are awarded to as many qualified students as possible based on available scholarship funding.</p>

MIAMI 2040 is an unprecedented opportunity for Miami’s youth to engage in solving the problems of the future city they will inhabit. Miami College of Design and high school students from South Florida will design solutions for the most daunting challenges for South Florida facing the next generation. At the end of a series of workshops, in which the students will have worked in teams with world-renowned industrial designers, their proposed solutions will be presented in June at DEEP SEE, a two-week public art installation on the shores of Miami Beach, adjacent to the US Conference of Mayors.

          <p><span>
For the third year in a row, a new record for global temperature was set: 2016 was the hottest year ever recorded. Climate change is not just an abstract problem for future generations; it is happening now. Coastal populations are among most vulnerable, and South Florida arguably faces the most pointed risks of any region in the United States for sea-level rise, storm surge, and intensification of hurricanes. As residents of South Florida, we cannot afford to wait for others to fix a problem as complex, massive, and pressing as climate change. We need to take local action.

          <h2 class="uppercase">The MIAMI 2040 Workshop Series</h2>
          <p><span>
Beginning on 4 March, high-school students in South Florida will have an opportunity to do something tangible about climate change. Working with the design faculty of the Miami College of Design, workshop participants will engage in a six-week program to design both systemic and specific solutions for one of the first US regions projected to be partially underwater within the next several decades.
	  </span></p>
          <p><span>
Every Saturday morning in March and the first half of April, students will gather in Wynwood to work with the faculty in hands-on sessions. Wednesday evenings, the faculty will hold office hours for fielding questions and for providing additional mentoring.
	  </span></p>
          <p><span>
At the 4 March workshop, students will work with a data scientist, applying models to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the private sector in order to define the conditions and specific risks that the City of Miami will face in 2040.
	  </span></p>
          <p><span>
In subsequent workshops, the faculty of the Miami College of Design will apply the college’s philosophy of practical learning—learning-by-doing. Students will drive the conversation by identifying the problems they want to work on, self-selecting into design teams, which will be lead through a process of discovery, framing, and prototyping, culminating in a design proposal.
	  </span></p>

          <p><span>
      The workshop series will cover the following topics:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 1: CLIMATE SCIENCE AND RISK<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 2: INTRODUCTION TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN PROCESS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 2: CONTEXTUALIZING DESIGN IDEAS WITH DATA SCIENCE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 3: IDEATION AND RAPID PROTOTYPING<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 4: ENGAGEMENT WITH PRACTITIONERS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 5: TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY STUDIES<br>
