	    <ul>
	      <li>Applicants must provide official transcripts of all secondary academic work through the most recent grading period. High school counselors may submit transcripts through email or mail.</li>
	      <li>For applicants who completed college credit at an accredited college, transcripts may be submitted for evaluation for transfer of credit.</li>
	      <li>Results of the SAT Reasoning Test or the ACT (American College Testing program) are not required.</li>
	      <li>Applicant portfolios must include at least five examples of your best recent work. The work should reflect the full range of your ideas, interests, experience and abilities in design and engineering. Work presented can be in any medium (including film or video), in finished or sketch form, as well as an assigned project or a self-directed exploration. Selected pages from a journal or sketchbook are recommended, to demonstrate your research, thinking and investigation approach. Portfolios must be submitted electronically (through Google Docs, DropBox, or some other file-sharing mechanism).</li>
	      <li>An essay or sample of your writing, up to 1000 words.</li>
	      <li>Letter(s) of Recommendation. At least two letters are required and as many as four may be submitted.

	    </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>You may invite people to write letters of recommendation. Letters may be sent directly to admissions@miamicollegeofdesign.com.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Interview and Performance Assessment</em></h3>
All applicants will have a face-to-face in person or electronic admissions interview. During the interview, applicants will be asked to complete a writing and problem-solving exercise. Beforehand, applicants are encouraged to reach out to faculty, staff, and students to gain an understanding of the school environment.

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Acceptance by Institution </em></h3>
Admissions decisions will be made within one month following the completion of: (1) application, (2) interview, (3) submission of all required documents, and (4) review by the Admissions Committee. 

	  <p>The criteria for acceptance into the program are based on a multi-dimensional metric. This includes:
	    <ul>
	      <li>academic achievement;</li>
	      <li>quality of the applicant's portfolio and writing samples;</li>
	      <li>the Interview;</li>
	      <li>the results of the performance assessment;</li>
	      <li>letters of recommendation;</li>
	      <li>Admissions Committee assessment of character, talent, and ambition.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>

	  <p>The Catalog and the Enrollment Agreement constitute a binding contract between the student and Miami College of Design. Students receive a Catalog one week prior to enrolling. Please read both documents carefully prior to signing the Enrollment Agreement.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Language</em></h3>
	  <p>All courses are offered only in English.</p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Transfer of Credit Hours</em></h3>
	  <p>Some credit hours may be evaluated and considered towards program completion. The applicant must present a transcript and catalog from the institution where the courses were completed. The institution must be accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency and the grade must be a “B” or higher. Students must complete at least 50% of their course work at Miami College of Design in order to receive a degree. Tuition will be prorated.</p>

	  <p>Students may wish to continue their training after graduation. While Miami College of Design is licensed by the Florida Commission for Independent Education, it is not accredited. Some or none of the course work completed at Miami College of Design may be transferable to other institutions. Therefore, the student must contact the institution s/he is transferring to as each institution has its own requirements regarding acceptance of transfer of credit hours. There is no guarantee of transfer of credit hours from one institution to another and specifically from Miami College of Design to any other post-secondary school or college. </p>

	  <h3 class="uppercase"><em>Life Experience Credit </em></h3>
	  <p>Miami College of Design accepts up to 15 credit hours of life experience.  Applicants must select courses for which they seek life experience credit.  For each course, applicants must show how their specific experience meets the objectives of that course.  This is done by completing forms, provided by the school, and including examples of work, job descriptions, and/or testimonials from employers.  The Life Experience Application Package is reviewed by the Admissions Officer.  When complete, then the Application package is submitted to a Life Experience Review Committee.  Tuition for courses accepted for Life Experience credit will be prorated.</p>
